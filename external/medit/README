"Capping" seems to mean cutting a planar slice. *Not* the mountain top view. So
capTetraMap creates a display list for the planar slice view. And listTetraMap
creates one for the mountain top view.

pXYZ is a pointer to XYZ.

pTransform contains many members that are really just deltas (changes) in
axis-angle, pan etc.
