igl_lib is a lightweight C++ for mesh processing

Example1.cpp: 
- Load/save a mesh
- Compute face and edge topology
- Compute the cotan matrix of the loaded mesh

Example2.cpp:
- Shows how it is possible to send/receive matrices to/from matlab
in order to use the matlab functions in the igl_toolbox

To run example2 you need matlab and to properly configure your PATH and DYLD_PATH.
