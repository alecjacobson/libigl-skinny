    <h1>.bf - bone forests</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
A .bf file contains a bone forest. That is possibly multiple bone trees, or
skeletons. Singleton trees will be interpreted as point handles. Otherwise
each edge in a tree will be interpreted as a bone segment.
    </p>
    <p>
Each line contains data about a vertex (joint) of a bone tree:
    </p>
    <pre><code>[weight index] [parent index] [x] [y] [z] [undocument optional data]</code></pre>
    <p>
Indices begin with 0.  The weight index is -1 if the bone does not have an
associated weight. The parent index is -1 for root nodes.
